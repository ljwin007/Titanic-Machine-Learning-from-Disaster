# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
It is a project on Kaggle platform.
Objective was to apply tools of Machine Learning to predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.
Worked with Python Pandas packages on train and test datasets, obtained distribution of numerical and categorical features.
Arrived at assumptions for correlating, completing, correcting, creating and classifying based on data analysis, validated these assumptions further and executed these assumptions and decisions regarding datasets as solution requirements.
Performed analysis by visualizing data.
Trained model, predicted the solutions on training datasets using predictive modelling algorithms: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forrest, Perceptron, Artificial Neural Network, Relevance Vector Machine
Performed model evaluation and found Random Forrest the best model based on confidence score generated by the model.
Obtained a score of 77.99% on my submission of prediction of survival on test dataset using Random Forrest algorithm.
